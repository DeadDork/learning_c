I'm too sexy for my love too sexy for my love
love's going to leave me

I'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my shirt
so sexy it hurts
and I'm too sexy for Milan too sexy for Milan
New York and Japan

and I'm too sexy for your party
too sexy for your party
no way I'm disco dancing

I'm a model you know what I mean
and I do my little turn on the catwalk
yeah on the catwalk on the catwalk yeah
I do my little turn on the catwalk

I'm too sexy for my car too sexy for my car
too sexy by far
and I'm too sexy for my hat
too sexy for my hat what do you think about that

I'm a model you know what I mean
and I do my little turn on the catwalk
yeah on the catwalk on the catwalk yeah
I shake my little touche on the catwalk

I'm too sexy for my too sexy for my too sexy for my

'cos I'm a model you know what I mean
and I do my little turn on the catwalk
yeah on the catwalk on the catwalk yeah
I shake my little touche on the catwalk

I'm too sexy for my cat too sexy for my cat
poor pussy poor pussy cat
I'm too sexy for my love too sexy for my love
love's going to leave me

and I'm too sexy for this song
